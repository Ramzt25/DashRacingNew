## 📊 Current Statistics

| Module | Tests Passing | Completion Rate | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Authentication | 9/9 | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Vehicle Management | 6/9 | 67% | 🟡 Nearly Complete |
| Race Management | 0/12 | 0% | 🔴 Not Started |
| WebSocket Features | 0/7 | 0% | 🔴 Not Started |
| **TOTAL** | **15/37** | **41%** | 🟡 In Progress |

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- **Authentication**: 100% achieved ✅
- **Vehicle CRUD**: 67% achieved, target 100%
- **Race Management**: 0% achieved, target 100%
- **WebSocket Features**: 0% achieved, target 100%
- **Overall Target**: 37/37 tests passing (100%)

## 🔑 Key Technical Achievements
1. **Robust Authentication System** - JWT-based auth with 100% test coverage
2. **Advanced Database Mapping** - Creative field mapping to overcome schema limitations
3. **Comprehensive CRUD Operations** - Full vehicle lifecycle management
4. **Search & Filtering** - Query parameter-based vehicle search
5. **Authorization Framework** - User-specific data access controls

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority
1. **HIGH**: Fix remaining 3 vehicle tests (performance endpoint + auth consistency)
2. **HIGH**: Implement race management system (12 tests)
3. **MEDIUM**: Add WebSocket real-time features (7 tests)
4. **LOW**: Resolve TypeScript compilation issues
5. **LOW**: Optimize database field mapping strategy

**Current Progress: 15/37 tests passing (41% complete)**
**Target: 37/37 tests passing (100% complete)**
